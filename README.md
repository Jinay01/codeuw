# CodeUW

CodeUW gives UW students the opportunity to gain hands-on coding experience by contributing to scientific software. The repo maintains a collection
of tasks across a variety of projects from the [Scientific Software Engineering Center (SSEC)](https://escience.washington.edu/software-engineering/ssec/). The tasks are defined by SSEC engineers and are meant to be small and self-contained pieces of work that can be done in under a week. 

By working on these tasks, students have the opportunity to work with SSEC engineers, who will act as mentors, review the code and provide feedback.


## Pre-requisites

- Being a UW student
- Familiarity with [GitHub](https://github.com):
    - Having a github account
    - Knowledge of basic operations, such as pulling/forking a repo, creating branches, making commits and pushing. 
    - [This](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/) is a good resource for getting started on GitHub. 
- Programming experience
    - Fluency in the task's programming language. Most tasks will use `python`, although certain tasks may require other languages.
    - For python, familiarity with virtual environments and package managers such as `venv`, `pip` and `conda`.    


## Picking up a task

- Search through the [list of issues](issues) in the repo to find a suitable one. Tasks are categorized in 3 levels:
    - **L1**: Simple task that can be done in a few hours. These tasks have low coding complexity and won't require much project ramp-up time. Great task to practice the life-cycle of a pull request.
    - **L2**: Moderate task which may take a couple of days. Will likely require setting up a virtual environment to run the project and get a good understanding of a portion of it, e.g. a module.
    - **L3**: A step up from L3, likely to take about a week. This type will be either higher coding complexity or have broader scope (ie. multiple modules). 
- Assign the task to yourself. The expectation is that you'll complete the task within the expected timeline (per level) so make sure you'll be able to devote a few hours a day to this.
- Email the the task owner (SSEC engineer) to let them know you'll be working on this and to ask any initial questions/clarifications
